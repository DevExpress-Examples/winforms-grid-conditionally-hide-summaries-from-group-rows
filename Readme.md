# WinForms Data Grid - Show/hide summaries in group rows based on a specific condition

This example handles the [CustomDrawGroupRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView.CustomDrawGroupRow) event to update text in group rows (show/hide certain summaries) based on a condition. The Max summary is displayed for group rows where Discontinued is True. The Min summary is displayed in rows with Discontinued set to False.
